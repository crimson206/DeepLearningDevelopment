# Deep Learning Development

I have recently initiated this project.

Most ideas were inspired by Kaggle Competitions.
Currently, most of the code is related to transformers because I am only participating in competitions involving sequential data.

# Request for Contributions
I am in the process of adding simple descriptions and usage instructions for each module in the format of `z_ModuleName.ipynb`.

While these descriptions may eventually be moved to a different repository, I anticipate maintaining this format for the time being. If there is a specific module you are interested in and would like to know how to use, please feel free to contact me directly. I can provide you with a simple example to help you get started.

# Demo Version

You can install a demo version.
Currently, most modules are transformer-based.  
I will upload example usages soon.

Use the following line to install this project:  
`pip install git+https://github.com/crimson206/DeepLearningDevelopment@0.1.4`

Useful embedding modules can be found in:  
`from CrimsonDeepLearning.transformers.embeddings import ...`

# Recommended Notebooks
- Params Shaker: This notebook is designed to search for the global optimum with randomness.
