# Deep Learning Development

Implemented Models :

1. VAEformer (personal model)
   From z_latent, we generate a normal distribution, which will generate random result.

2. MultiEmbeddingFormer (personal model)
   It uses different types of data as input, s.t. "Categorical", "Continuous", "Periodical" amd "Multi Positions".

3. StyleGan2 (NVIDIA)
   It was implemented similarily to the original StyleGan2 by NVIDIA.
